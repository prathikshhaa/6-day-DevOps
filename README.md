# DevOps Training Overview

Welcome to the **DevOps Training** journey! Over the course of the training, we explored powerful tools and concepts essential for modern software development and infrastructure management. This training covered everything from cloud computing and automation to containerization, orchestration, and microservices. Let's dive into the key highlights and what was learned throughout the training.

---

## 🌥️ Cloud Computing & AWS EC2

We kicked off by diving into **Cloud Computing**, focusing on **AWS EC2**, and learning how to manage cloud infrastructure. 

### Key Highlights:
- **Cloud Service Models**: Explored **IaaS**, **PaaS**, and **SaaS**, with hands-on experience with **AWS** as an **IaaS** provider.
- **EC2 Instances**: Configured, launched, and managed **EC2 instances** on AWS.
- **Linux Families**: Worked with **Red Hat** and **Debian-based Linux** systems, installing and configuring **Apache HTTP** server.
- **AWS Credentials**: Learned to configure and securely manage **AWS credentials** for automation tasks.

### Key Commands:
<pre><code>
# Install Apache HTTP Server on EC2
yum install httpd -y

# Start the Apache server
service httpd start
</code></pre>

## 🛠️ Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

We delved deep into **Terraform** to automate cloud infrastructure provisioning, reducing manual intervention and ensuring consistency.

### Key Highlights:
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Understood the concept of IaC and applied it with **Terraform** to manage AWS resources.
- **Terraform Commands**: Worked with **Terraform scripts** to create and manage resources like EC2 instances, VPCs, and more.
- **State Management**: Explored how Terraform tracks resources and maintains the state of infrastructure.

### Key Terraform Commands:
<pre><code>
# Initialize Terraform and set up cloud provider configuration
terraform init

# Validate configuration files
terraform validate

# View execution plan to check proposed changes
terraform plan

# Apply the configuration to create resources
terraform apply

# Destroy the resources created by Terraform
terraform destroy
</code></pre>

## 🐳 Docker & Containerization

**Docker** was introduced to provide a platform for creating **portable applications**. We explored how containerization improves efficiency and resource usage.

### Key Highlights:
- **Docker Basics**: Learned how Docker allows applications to run in isolated containers, promoting **microservices architecture**.
- **Container Management**: Created, started, and managed Docker containers and images.
- **Microservices**: Moved from monolithic applications to a microservices approach, deploying each service independently.

### Key Docker Commands:
<pre><code>
# Install Docker on an EC2 instance
yum install docker -y

# Start Docker service
service docker start

# Create a container from the Ubuntu image
docker create ubuntu /bin/bash

# Run the container
docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash

# List all containers
docker ps -a

# Start a specific container by ID
docker start <container_id>
</code></pre>

## 🚀 Kubernetes for Container Orchestration

We explored **Kubernetes**, the powerful container orchestration platform that automates container management, scaling, and deployment in production.

### Key Highlights:
- **Kubernetes Basics**: Introduced to Kubernetes concepts like **pods**, **deployments**, and **services**.
- **Scaling and Managing Applications**: Used **kubectl** commands to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications.
- **Cluster Management**: Managed Kubernetes clusters for high availability and reliability.

### Key Kubernetes Commands:
<pre><code>
# Deploy an application to Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f <deployment_yaml>

# Scale the number of replicas
kubectl scale deployment <deployment_name> --replicas=3

# Check the status of the pods
kubectl get pods

# Expose the application as a service
kubectl expose deployment <deployment_name> --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080
</code></pre>

## 🌐 Web Application Deployment & Git Integration

Throughout the training, we also focused on **Git** for version control, automating deployment with **Terraform**, and using **Docker** to manage application containers.

### Key Highlights:
- **Git Integration**: Pushed code to remote repositories and automated workflows using Git and Terraform.
- **CI/CD Workflow**: Integrated deployment processes with **Terraform** and **Docker**, ensuring smooth and scalable applications.

### Key Git Commands:
<pre><code>
# Clone the repository from GitHub
git clone -b master https://github.com/prathikshhaa/Dimple-CapsuleProject.git

# Add remote origin to the repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/prathikshhaa/DevOps-terraform-script.git

# Push code to GitHub
git push --set-upstream origin master
</code></pre>

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

By the end of the training, here are the core concepts I mastered:

1. **Cloud Infrastructure Management**: Leveraged AWS EC2 instances for cloud computing and resource management.
2. **Automation with Terraform**: Automated the creation and management of cloud resources using Terraform scripts.
3. **Containerization with Docker**: Gained hands-on experience in containerizing applications, enabling platform-independent deployments.
4. **Kubernetes Orchestration**: Learned how Kubernetes simplifies the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
5. **Version Control & CI/CD**: Integrated Git for version control and automated deployment pipelines with Terraform and Docker.
